      <p>I live in Denver, CO, and while working full time as an admissions counselor, I have been learning to code in DU's full stack coding bootcamp. So far, I have learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, and I am beginning to learn about Node. I have also learned how to use APIs and local storage. My coding bootcamp ends in mid-September. What I plan to do with my coding knowledge: Full honesty--I'm still deciding. I entered a full stack bootcamp knowing I was ready for a career change. I like to be sucked into projects and fiddle until I have found a solution. I've truly enjoyed this journey so far and I can't wait to learn more. Feel free to follow my journey as well by <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/katie-thorpe-343064181" target="_blank">checking out my LinkedIn page</a> or <a href="./images/KatieThorpesResumeNoContact (1).pdf" target="_blank">look at my updated resume</a>.</p>
      <p>When I have spare time, I love getting out to the mountains and hiking. I really value time with my family and close friends. Gameboard nights, time spent in with a book, and watching old movies or Project Runway/reality romance shows are a favorite past time of mine. Put me in front of a puzzle or a project and I will dive into it for hours. I also have a cat that is the poster child for cat obesity, Harold, and he is very wonderful. Thanks for reading!
